(1) short game description

Antropy is a game about managing an ant colony. You need to carefully assign ants to collect food or tend to eggs to ensure the
survival of the colony. There are 4 seasons in total, in the first three (spring, summer and autumn) you prepare for the winter.
During winter your ants will die and consume the food that they have acumulated.
You also need to pay attention to the distance of the food source from the anthill and also not to overwork the tiles so that
you consume all the resources on that tile!
